<h1>Frozen</h1>
<p>You all mey be wondering what caused the hype of frozen. I will tell you. Little girls wanting powers, and hair.</p>
<h2>Love in Frozen</h2>
<p>In this enchanting tale, Anna is in love with Cristoph her fiance. They fight snow monsters, and rock trolls together. They also look for her wierd sister Elsa, who doesnt know who she is, and attacks random people. If you are like me, and have watched the details you havent seen before in frozen video, you would have seen the small error that cristoph's hand goes through annas body when the jump together. 
<h3>My view</h3>
<p>I used to love frozen, like any child. But reflecting back, I dont understand the hype. It was like every other disney movie in history. So why did I like it so much? My answer, elsa's hair. The majestic and bleach blond locks she has, were any girls desire. I spent hours thinking of having hair like that. Overall, no more hype</p>
